INSTALLATION

you need python2.4, and also whatever is required to make
catalog/marc/marc8_to_utf8.pl run.  you can test that the
script is in basic working order by running
test-marc8_to_utf8.sh while in that directory.

HOW TO IMPORT CATALOG DATA

the source file must be in the "catalog source repository",
currently /1/pharos/sources.

within that directory, there is a directory for each format.
(e.g., "marc", "onix", "oca".)

for example, to import the data in
/1/pharos/sources/marc/lc/part01.dat, do this:

make your own copy of catalog/import.sh in order to
configure it to point to your repository, to import to the
appropriate database, etc.

then:

my-import.sh marc lc/part01.dat
