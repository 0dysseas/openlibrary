We can\'t do it without your help. \r\n\r\nIf you can help with anything do not hesitate to [contact us](/about/contact)!\r\n\r\nHere are some things we can use your help on, categorized by skill:\r\n\r\n## Making phone calls\r\n\r\nA site like this requires massive amounts of data; we\'ll take whatever we can get our hands on. Most of the data in the book world is locked up behind contracts or access restrictions. By contrast, we put everything we can on the Internet for free. But there\'s more data than we can collect by ourselves. That\'s where you come in: you can help us by making the phone calls with various data providers to try and get us their data.\r\n\r\n### Libraries\r\n\r\nLots of libraries have large catalog collections stored as [MARC](http://www.loc.gov/marc/) data. If you can get your favorite friendly library to send us a dump of their data, we\'ll be forever indebted. Status:\r\n\r\n* Library of Congress: [imported](http://www.archive.org/details/marc_records_scriblio_net) (8M books)\r\n* University of California: no response (12M books)\r\n* British Library: to pursue\r\n* Bibliotheque Nationale de France: to pursue\r\n* National Archives of Canada: to pursue\r\n* national libraries of other countries: to pursue\r\n* any other libraries you can get your hands on: send them to us!\r\n\r\n### Publishers\r\n\r\nMost publishers provide "[ONIX feeds](http://www.bisg.org/documents/onix.html)" -- XML export of all their information about the books they publish. Unfortunately, you generally need to call them and make a deal to get these feeds. If you can pick a favorite publisher and try to work out a deal for us, you\'ll be doing a service for the cause of freedom. Lots of presses are owned by larger companies, so you might want to follow the ownership ladder to make sure you end up with as many records as possible.  Status:\r\n\r\n* HarperCollins: [imported](http://archive.org/details/catalog_harpercollins)\r\n* Simon and Schuster: [imported](http://archive.org/details/catalog_simonschuster)\r\n* Random House: [imported](http://www.archive.org/details/catalog_randomhouse)\r\n* Cambridge University Press: [imported](http://archive.org/details/catalog_cambridge)\r\n* Penguin: downloaded\r\n* Wiley: [downloaded](http://www.archive.org/details/catalog_wiley/)\r\n* Thomas Nelson: downloaded\r\n* [other publishers...](publishers)\r\n\r\n### Swap sites\r\n\r\n* BookMooch.

You want your search engine to bring up _The Da Vinci Code_ before _The Da Vinci Method_, if only because the numbers say that\'s more likely what people want. And when you\'re importing a book that says its by David Eggers, you want to guess it\'s the author of _A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius_ and not _Physical Chemistry: A Textbook_. Similarly, good popularity data can keep you from recommending people things like _Harry Potter_.\r\n\r\n* Amazon.com salesrank: proprietary\r\n* Bookscan sales numbers: proprietary\r\n* Library circulation data: to pursue\r\n* LibraryThing: [received](http://www.librarything.com/feeds/)\r\n* Web mentions: to pursue\r\n* Store/library availability: to pursue (see price checker below)\r\n* our page view data: once we get more popular\r\n\r\n### Respect data\r\n\r\nStrict popularity isn\'t the only thing that matters. We also want to know whether the book is respected, even if it\'s not a bestseller.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you happen to have a copy of the Book Review Digest CD-ROM, we\'d be massively indebted. The following libraries [supposedly have a copy](http://worldcat.org/oclc/30590649):\r\n\r\n* Los Angeles Public Library (we called them and they can\'t find their copy; it might be worth bothering them more)\r\n* Mohave County Library District (Kingman, AZ)\r\n* Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, IL)\r\n* World Book (Chicago, IL)\r\n* Indianapolis Public Library\r\n* Library of Congress\r\n* Pentagon Library\r\n* Saint Augustine\'s College (Raleigh, NC)\r\n* Nova Southeastern University (Ft. Lauderdale, FL)\r\n* US Military Academy (West Point, NY)\r\n* Universit\xc3\xa9 de Montr\xc3\xa9al (Montreal, QC)\r\n* Univ. of Nottingham (Nottingham, UK)\r\n* University of Hong Kong (Pokfulam, HK)\r\n* North West Univ. Potchefstroom Campus (NW, South Africa)\r\n\r\nOther collections of reviews include:\r\n\r\n* Book Review Index\r\n* major journals (LJ, PW, Booklist)\r\n* intra-book citations\r\n* awards\r\n\r\nIs there an online review aggregation site for books? Metacritic only does a handful.\r\n\r\n### Inter-book relations\r\n\r\n* ThingISBN: to pursue\r\n* xISBN: to pursue\r\n* FRBRizing algorithms: to be coded\r\n\r\n### Copyright information\r\n\r\n* Registration and renewal records\r\n* Orphaned works data (from users and other archivists)\r\n* Our own registration service\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\nIf you know other people with library data, we\'d love that too.\r\n\r\n## Library science\r\n\r\n[See our page on librarianship](/about/lib) for things you can help with.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nWe want our site to look as good as possible, which means we\'re always interested in new designs. Luckily, Infogami has a powerful templating system that allows you to create your own look and feel for the site. For more information, read [the guide to our wiki language](http://demo.openlibrary.org/dev/docs/wikilanguage). [Let us know](/about/contact) if you have questions or have developed a nifty new template.\r\n\r\n## Programming\r\n\r\nLots of our work here requires programming. If you have a lot of time, you can hop right in and become a serious developer on Infogami or Open Library. (Check out [our bug list](https://bugs.launchpad.net/openlibrary/+bugs?field.searchtext=&orderby=-importance&search=Search&field.status%3Alist=New&field.status%3Alist=Incomplete&field.status%3Alist=Confirmed&field.status%3Alist=In+Progress&assignee_option=any&field.assignee=&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_contact=&field.omit_dupes.used=&field.omit_dupes=on&field.has_patch.used=&field.tag=&field.has_cve.used=).) But if you have less time, perhaps you can pick up a smaller project:\r\n\r\n### Price check\r\n\r\nWe want Open Library to be a hub for all the book information on the Internet. As part of that, we\'re developing plugins to grab data from other sites. For example, we\'d like code that checks prices at various stores and lists them, code that sees which libraries a book is available at near a zip code, code which checks to see if a book is available in a Borders near a bookstore, etc. We\'d also like code that sees whether a book is available at particular libraries or on particular book trading sites (like bookmooch).\r\n\r\n### Export\r\n\r\nWe\'d love to have our data exported in RDF/XML, database dumps, OAI, microformats, Z39.50, a cover repository API.', 'title': 'How you can help'}}
