SETUP

cp example-config.sh config.sh
# perhaps edit config.sh ... this allows the tests to work,
# including test-MARC21Charset.py and test-show-marc.sh

in general, to use this code as library components, check
config.sh for environment variables that will be necessary
for proper operation.  specific notes follow.

SHOW-MARC

to use phr's "show-marc" cgi program, arrange for the
environment variables in example-config.sh to be set
appropriately when show-marc.py is run.

you can test the cgi program with test-show-marc.sh

PARSE

the charset-conversion helper-program, marc8_to_utf8.pl,
requires that the MARC::Charset module be installed.  it is
available here: http://search.cpan.org/dist/MARC-Charset/

you can test the parser with parse-test.sh, although you may
have to fiddle some paths in there in order to find the MARC
source files.  (technically, the data files should be
retrieved from the archive using a particular file_locator,
cached locally, and parsed.)

see http://demo.openlibrary.org/about/catalog for
information about how records are identified and retrieved.
