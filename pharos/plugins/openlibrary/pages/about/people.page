Anand received his Masters in Computational Science from the Indian Institute of Science before becoming technical leader at Strand Life Sciences. Working full-time for Open Library from India, he was in charge of development for ThingDB, our database system, and Infogami, our wiki software, and took part in building many of the other pieces.\r\n\r\n**Daniel Giffin**, Programmer. After a career moving between computer science academia and computer science startups, Giffin was in charge of importing catalog data, as he worked for Open Library from New York. He designed our basic schema and wrote the initial importers for Library of Congress and other publisher data.\r\n\r\n**Paul Rubin**, Programmer. One day when I was working across the table from Paul, some other people in the building were trying to write a program using `rm`, the Unix utility to delete things, when they checked the man page. They quickly spun around. "Hey Paul," they asked. "Did you write `rm`?" "Oh yeah," Paul replied, with a dismissive wave of his hand. "But that was a long time ago." Paul worked from Internet Archive\'s offices in San Francisco to build our search engine and help with importing.\r\n\r\n**Rebecca Malamud**, Designer. Malamud is the design genius behind `media.org`, `invisible.net`, `mappa.mundi.net`, `betterdogfood.com`, `resource.org`, and dozens of other brilliantly named and designed sites. She worked from Sixes, Oregon to make the Open Library site look good.\r\n\r\n**Alexis Rossi**, Manager. Rossi has worked as a news content manager at ClariNet, the first online news aggregator, as editorial director at Alexa Internet, and in the collections group at Internet Archive. She squeezed data from publishers, code from programmers, and made sure all the servers ran on time.\r\n\r\n**Aaron Swartz**, Leader. Swartz has worked on specs like RSS, startups like Reddit.com, and software projects like web.py. He worked from San Francisco to architect the site, put together the team, and attempt to keep things organized. He still has not gotten paid.\r\n\r\n**Brewster Kahle**, Overseer. Kahle is the founder of WAIS, Alexa Internet, and Internet Archive, which he currently runs. He oversaw the project, flew around the country promoting it, and cut the checks.', 'title': 'About the people'}}
