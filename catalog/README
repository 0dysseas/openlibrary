INSTALLATION

you need python2.4, and, to import MARC catalogs, whatever
is required by catalog/marc/marc8_to_utf8.pl, including
this:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/MARC-Charset/

you can test that the script is in basic working order by
running test-marc8_to_utf8.sh while in that directory.

HOW TO IMPORT CATALOG DATA

the source file must be in the "catalog source repository",
currently /1/pharos/sources, but configurable as described
below.

within that directory, there is a directory for each format.
(e.g., "marc", "onix", "oca".)

for example, to import the data in
/1/pharos/sources/marc/lc/part01.dat, do this:

make your own copy of catalog/import.sh in order to
configure it to point to your repository, to import to the
appropriate database, etc.

then:

my-import.sh marc lc/part01.dat

CAVEAT

there is code in catalog/import.py that looks up all the ids
of editions that have already been imported.  it incorrectly
ignores the "parent" of each edition, meaning that it will
import a record only once for each database, regardless of
the "site".  (of course, this is not a problem if you only
ever use one site object.)
