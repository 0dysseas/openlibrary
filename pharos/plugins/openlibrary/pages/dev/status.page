To access it:\r\n\r\n     $ sudo -u anand screen -x\r\n     Cannot open your terminal \'/dev/pts/0\' - please check.\r\n     $ sudo chown anand /dev/pts/0\r\n     $ sudo -u anand screen -x\r\n     [ hit `C-a 0` to make sure you\'re on the right screen ]\r\n\r\nIt should be printing out some debug messages. Hit C-c to kill and up-arrow to start again.\r\n\r\n## Postgres\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\n## Solr\r\nSolr currently runs on pharosdb from ~phr/petabox/solr, running as phr.  There are\r\nactually two solr servers, the demo one on port 8983 and a development one (solr2) on port  8993.\r\n\r\n### Stopping solr:\r\nThere is a solr.sh script with a stop command but that doesn\'t seem to do anything.\r\nInstead, to stop either server, run "netstat -lp" to find the process id of the server you want to\r\nstop (probably 8983).  Then say "sudo kill 12345" (where 12345 is replaced by the actual\r\nprocess id).  The process will actually then increase its cpu and disk activity as it puts\r\nits affairs in order, and will keep running for a minute or two before exiting.  It is probably\r\nunwise to circumvent this with kill -9, or at least I haven\'t so far felt the need to see what happens.\r\n\r\n### Starting solr:\r\ncd to ~phr/petabox/solr for the demo server or ~phr/petabox/solr2 for the devel server.\r\nThen say "sudo -u phr solr.sh start".  You will see a few messages and the script will pause for\r\n5 seconds before starting the jvm.  It takes a few seconds after that before solr is ready\r\nto accept connections.\r\n\r\nThe solr admin screen is http://pharosdb.us.archive.org:8983/solr/admin for the demo\r\nserver, http://pharosdb.us.archive.org:8993/solr/admin for the development server.\r\n\r\n', 'title': 'Site status'}}
