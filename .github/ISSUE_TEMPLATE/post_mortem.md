## Steps to close
<!-- For instructions, please see: https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Disaster-History-Log#how-to -->
1. [ ] Assignment: Is someone assinged to this issue? (notetaker, responder)
2. [ ] Labels: Is there an `Affects:` label applied?
3. [ ] Diagnosis: Add a description and scope of the issue
4. [ ] Updates: As events unfold, is noteable **provenance** documented in issue comments? (i.e. useful debug commands / steps / learnings / reference links)
5. [ ] Resolution: Once the event is resolved, is the **resolution** documented here?
6. [ ] Followup: Are there **decisions** such as changes to mitigate future risk? 

## Diagnosis (What's wrong?)
<!-- When was it noted, what is the issue, what is the scope? -->

## Resolution (What fixed it)
<!-- Edit this issue once resolved to include a description of the solution, when it was resolved --> 

## Followup (Decisions)
<!-- Edit this issue once resolved to note any resulting process changes or decisions -->
