The entries for all authors of the book must exist before you can add the book.  The URL for a book author is:\r\n\r\n   http://demo.openlibrary.org/a/Lastname_Firstname\r\n\r\n  If this page does not exist, OpenLibrary will give you an option to create it by visiting the URL:\r\n\r\n  http://demo.openlibrary.org/a/Lastname_Firstname?m=edit\r\n\r\n  In this page, enter "type/author" as the page type and click the Change button to get the edit template for authors.  Enter the authors name in the following way:\r\n\r\n  Lastname, Firstname\r\n\r\n  Also enter any extra information you want, for example date of birth and death (if applicable).\r\n\r\n* Then you can create the book in a similar way.  Visit\r\n\r\n  http://demo.openlibrary.org/b/Title_Of_Book\r\n\r\n  If the book does not exist, follow the "create it" link (which appends ?m=edit as above), and give "type/edition" as the page type, submit with "Change".\r\n\r\n  Now you can enter the metadata for the book.  In the Authors field, enter "a/Lastname_Firstname".  Unfortunately, the editor is very picky, so if you get a bogus error message (try to give a non-existing author for example), you got some form wrong which expects a special format.  Some form fields are free-style.  You should look at known good book entries in edit mode for an idea what is put into the form fields.  "OAC" is short for Open Content Alliance.\r\n\r\nIf you find out more about the form fields, feel free to add it here!\r\n', 'title': 'HOW-TO add new books to the Open Library'}}
