## Overview of Event

## Steps to close

2. [ ] Label: Is there an `Affects:` label applied?
3. [ ] Diagnose: As events unfold, is noteable **provenance** documented in issue comments? (i.e. useful debug commands / steps / learnings / reference links)
4. [ ] Resolve: Once the event is resolved, is the **resolution** documented here?
5. [ ] Followup: Are there **decisions** such as changes to mitigate future risk? 

## 4. Resolution (What fixed it)

## Followup (Decisions)
