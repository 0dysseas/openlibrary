For the first time, we'll have an open, public, curated, universal catalog of all books. But this also presents an enormous challenge: we need to develop a schema for all that book information.\r\n\r\nLike the MARC format, we'll want our schema to contain all the important bibliographic information that librarians want to collect about books. But we'll also want to take advantage of all the things we've learned since MARC. We'll also want to store some information that's of less importance to librarians, but of more importance to publishers (like the ONIX format stores) and arbitrary users. And we'll have to figure out how to present all this data in a way that makes sense to relatively untutored users.\r\n\r\nWe're currently calling this new schema _futurelib_ and we hope to hold a series of meetings for geeks, librarians, and booklovers to come together and hash out a proposal.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you might be interested in [our current draft schema](schema) which we threw together to get the demo up.\r\n\r\n### OLNs\r\n\r\nBut it's not just schemas. A universal catalog will also allow us to have a new, universal book identification scheme -- something akin to ISBNs or ISTNs, but for _all_ books, not just recent ones. We're currently calling this scheme _OLN_ for Open Library Number, but we'll need your help hashing out how it should work.\r\n\r\n### Merging\r\n\r\nA big part of our problem is collecting book information from multiple sources and merging it together: merging records from publishers and from libraries, merging together the same book when in different libraries, merging together the same book that has different editions, etc. We'll need your help developing algorithms that can do this effectively as well as in correcting the results when the algorithms go wrong.\r\n\r\n### Data collection\r\n\r\nWe want as much data as we can get our hands on. If you know anyone with data or know how to get some, please get in touch.\r\n\r\n### Further info\r\n\r\nWe're going to keep working on and discussing all these issues.
