While large in scope and ambition, this goal is within our grasp. Achieving it will require the participation of librarians, authors, government officials and technologists.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.openlibrary.org/"><img src="/static/covers/books.png" align="right" border="0" width="245"></a>\r\n\r\nImagine what a comprehensive, open library could be! A talented math whiz who lives in a rural community can explore the works of high math. An elderly person can have a large print edition of any book ever published. An innovative young scholar can publish a book directly to this great library on subjects that might not otherwise make it through the long and difficult publication process.\r\n\r\nThis site will start with catalog records for several million books, and about 150,000 out-of-copyright digitized books, and we\'ll add more records and more digitized books as they become available.\r\n\r\nHow can you help? Improve the records we have for the books you love \xe2\x80\x93 every record is fully editable by clicking the \xe2\x80\x9cedit\xe2\x80\x9d button on the page. If we don\'t have a record for a book, you can create one. If you have a scan of an out-of-copyright book, upload it! If you\'re a library with digitized resources, tell us where they are and we\'ll point people to them.\r\n\r\nOur hope is that libraries and individual book readers will join this project and together we can build towards universal access to all knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'title': 'The Open Library Vision'}}
